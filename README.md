# Document-Management-System

The purpose of document management system is to allow organization's employees to create, approve/reject and store documents.
The system allows to create users, usergroups, documents types and documents. Depending on employee's roles, they can not only create specific type documents but also approve/reject their colleagues'. For example, regular administration employee can create holidays request document which can be approved by management group's users. Also, the system allows to filter documents, see most created or approved documents. 

My role was mostly working with backend side of the project and writing services to execute business logic of the system. Used tools - Java 8, Spring Boot, JPA, Hibernate. Also, wrote some frontend code using Javascript and React framework.
